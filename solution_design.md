# S3 Multi-Tenant Storage Service - Design Document

## Overview

This service will provide a simplified, secure API layer on top of AWS S3, enabling multi-tenant file storage with proper access controls while hiding unnecessary S3 complexity from end users.

## System Architecture

The proposed architecture consists of:

- REST API Layer: Python-based service handling authentication and providing simplified file operations
- Access Control Layer: Manages permissions for tenants and users
- S3 Integration Layer: Handles all interaction with AWS S3
- Database: Stores metadata about files, users, and permissions

## Data Model

### Core Entities:

- Tenant: Organization or account with multiple users
- User: Individual with specific permissions
- File: Object stored in S3 with metadata
- Permission: Access control for files

### Entity Relationships:

- Tenants have many Users
- Users have Permissions on Files
- Files belong to a Tenant

## Storage Strategy

For the PoC, I will use a single bucket with tenant prefixes and a metadata database to handle file metadata and any mappings between the interface and S3.

- Bucket structure: bucket-name/tenant-id/file-path
- Pros: Simplifies management, reduces bucket proliferation
- Cons: Requires careful permission management

Metadata Database:
- Store file metadata (owner, permissions, creation date, etc.)
- Map logical file paths to actual S3 keys

## API Design

### Endpoints

```
# File Operations
GET    /api/v1/files/                                # List files
GET    /api/v1/files/<file_id>/Download              # Download file
POST   /api/v1/files/                                # Upload file
DELETE /api/v1/files/<file_id>                       # Delete file

# User/Permission Management
GET    /api/v1/permissions                           # Get file permissions
POST   /api/v1/permissions                           # Set permissions
```

## Security Model

1. Authentication: JWT-based with tenant and user identification
2. Authorization:
   - Per-file access control lists
   - Role-based permissions (Admin, Editor, Viewer)
   - Tenant isolation
3. S3 Security:
   - Generate temporary S3 credentials for direct uploads/downloads
   - No direct S3 bucket access for end users

## Technical Implementation (PoC)

### Technologies:

- Framework: Django/DRF (quick to set up, good documentation)
- Database: SQLite for PoC (easy to replace with PostgreSQL later)
- S3 Client: boto3
- Authentication: PyJWT

### Core Components:

#### API Service:

- REST endpoints for file operations
- Authentication middleware

#### Permission Engine:

- Check and enforce access rules
- Generate temporary credentials

#### S3 Manager:

- Interact with S3 using boto3
- Generate pre-signed URLs when needed

#### Database Models:

- Django ORM for data persistence
